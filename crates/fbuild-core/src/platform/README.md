# Host platform boundary

This directory is the single host-platform boundary for fbuild. `mod.rs`
contains the only production host selector. The public capability modules
expose neutral APIs; the private `windows`, `linux`, and `macos` trees own
native implementation details.

Embedded board/MCU selection and host artifact policy do not belong here.
