# Host platform boundary

This directory is the single host-platform boundary for fbuild. `mod.rs`
contains the only production host selector. The public capability modules
expose neutral APIs; the private `windows`, `linux`, and `macos` trees own
native implementation details.

Embedded board/MCU selection and host artifact policy do not belong here.

`host` exposes the current `HostPlatform` plus explicit values used by pure
product-owner tests. `executable` owns native executable and command-script
spelling. Product crates keep URL/checksum tables and embedded-target choices;
they pass or read neutral host facts instead of using raw `cfg!` queries.

`fs` owns host path and file identity, display rules, executable permissions,
link/reparse classification, volume facts, native error classification, shared
destination opening, atomic replacement, and blocked-I/O retirement. Cache
sizing, archive traversal, authorization, locking, diagnostics, and retry policy
remain with their product owners.
